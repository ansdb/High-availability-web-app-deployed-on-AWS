# High availability web app deployed on AWS

###### This is a Udacity nano degree project when I need to deploy a **high availability web app** on **AWS** platform using _cloud formation_ (IaC)

#### Major Project Components:

- #### Diagram.
The diagram illustrates the project/web app cloud _structure_ so that you can easily visualize the overall [_infrastructure_](https://www.github.com/ansdb/High-availability-web-app-deployed-on-AWS/#The-project-Diagram)

- #### Networking Infrastructure.
This is a cloud formation file that contains the necessary code to set up the networking infrastructure on the AWS cloud

- #### IAM Role.
Here you will find an IAM Role for the ec2 instances to access the S3 bucket to retreive web app files from it.

- #### Servers.
Here you will find all the nessecary resources to host your app and make it high available and scalable.
