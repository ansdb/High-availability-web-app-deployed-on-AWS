###### This is a Udacity nano degree project when I need to deploy a **high availability web app** on **AWS** platform using _cloud formation_ (IaC)

#### Major Project Components:

- #### Diagram.
The diagram illustrates the project/web app cloud _structure_ so that you can easily visualize the overall [_infrastructure_](https://www.github.com/ansdb/High-availability-web-app-deployed-on-AWS/#The-project-Diagram)
